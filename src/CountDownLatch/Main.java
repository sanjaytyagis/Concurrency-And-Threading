package CountDownLatch;
/*
   A CountDownLatch is a synchronization tool that waits until a count becomes zero.
   Threads wait until other threads finish their work.
   
   	Normally, CountDownLatch internally uses:

	A count to track remaining tasks.
	A Lock to protect count (atomic operations).
	A Condition to make threads wait if the count > 0.
	
	Method			Meaning
	await()			Lock + Wait until count = 0
	countDown()		Lock + Decrement count + Signal when count = 0
âœ… Threads calling await() wait until countDown() reduces the count to zero!
